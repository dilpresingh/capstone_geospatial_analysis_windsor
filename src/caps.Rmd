This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(tmap)
library(ggmap)
```


```{r}
file <- st_read("Arenas_UTM83.shp")
```

```{r}
file
```
```{r}
plot(st_geometry(file))
```

```{r}
file_1 <- read_sf("Arenas_UTM83.shp")
```

```{r}
#tm_shape(file_1) + 
    #tm_dots()


library(maps)
library(mapdata)

a <- map("worldHires","Canada",xlim=c(-116,68),ylim=c(30,47),col="gray90",fill=TRUE)

```
```{r}
ward_boundaries <- st_read("Municipal Ward Boundaries_UTM83.shp")
ward_boundaries
```

```{r}
tm_shape(ward_boundaries)+
  tm_fill()+
  tm_borders()+
  tmap_style("cobalt")+
  tm_shape(file)+
  tm_dots(size=0.3)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
