Spatial data analysis for the City of Windsor
Business Problem: Which Wards in Windsor are plagued with what specific non-emergency
(things like trash problems, trees down, potholes in the roads) issues and what are the
recommendations to mitigate them?
Windsor, with its safety, affordability, variety, and enjoyment, has become the place to be in
Canada! It's not simply that we're close to Detroit that makes us unique. Windsor, with its
steadily increasing population, is dedicated to becoming a lively destination that promotes
cultural variety. City of Windsor like many other cities in Canada is a great place to live and work.
It is situated across the Detroit River from the US city of Detroit and is a major contributor to
Canada’s automotive industry besides being culturally diverse. It has several issues which are
faced by the residents and are regularly reported to 311 customer request management system
from various channels, i.e., phone, email, online self-serve, text.
(City of Windsor, n.d.)
It has various service requests under its purview (examples listed below) as initiated by
respective customer’s perspective.
 Portable Sign Issue
 Litter Bin - Service
 Sign Issue
 Property Flooding / Grading
 Dog Complaint - Humane Society
 Litter Bin - Request New
 Skunk Inspection
 Building Accessibility
 Sewer Project
 Swimming Pool
 Parks - Playground Issues
 Snow & Ice - Dumping on Road/Alley
Looking at the types of service requests received, it is evident that the city has its own issues to
tackle. We are attempting to identify specific issues in various parts of the city by analysing the
311 service requests database performing spatial analysis on it.
Importance
All the issues reported at 311, though non-emergencies, are extremely important for the overall
improvement of the city as mitigation or resolving of these issues will result in better public
services. Theoretically, it is a perfect way for local bodies to learn what is on the residents’ minds
and gather a general idea of neighbourhood’s well-being.

Approach
In this project, we aim to conduct spatial EDA to find out which areas in the city have reported
specific issues. Out of the overall 52 categories of issues reported at 311 customer service, we
target to study top 15 problem categories each of which contributes more than 2% in the overall
bucket of reported issues.
Basis the outcomes of the target analysis, we plan to recommend several measures which will
better the present conditions resulting in the city’s overall improvement.
Tools
 R – for performing EDA
 Tableau – for visualization & dashboard
Success indicator
Basis the outcome of the project analysis, there will be specific measures/recommendations for
improving the present conditions as reported by residents from various parts of the city.
Recommendations supplied, if implemented, may result in reduction of the issues reported.
With this, a feedback survey will be recommended to gauge the satisfaction level of the people
who reported issues on 311.
